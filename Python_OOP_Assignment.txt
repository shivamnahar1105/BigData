# Q1. In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses 
objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, 
polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.

# Q2. An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, 
then in the class the instance was created from.


# Q3. Class object is a real copy of the class(i.e blueprint). Instance object is virtual copy of 
      the object.


# Q4. The self keyword is used to represent an instance object of the given class. 
    If there was no self argument, the same class couldn't hold the information for different objects.

# Q5. __init__ method lets you intialise the object attributes.

# Q6. To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in 
      whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.

# Q7. In python a class is created by the keyword class.

# Q8. The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. 

# Q9. Modules are collections of methods and constants. They cannot generate instances. 
      Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables).

# Q10. To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass 
       in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.

# Q11. Class attributes are the variables defined directly in the class
       that are shared by all objects of the class.

# Q12. Instance attributes are attributes or properties attached to an instance of a class. 
       Instance attributes are defined in the constructor.

# Q13. The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and
       is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

# Q14. Python class handle operator overloading by using special functions that starts and ends with __.

# Q15. The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond 
       their predefined operational meaning. We can consider using operartion overloading 
       when we want to use the same operator for different functionality. 
       Ex '+' operator can be used to add numbers, string or merge list.

# Q16. '+' Operator is the most popular exampole of operation overloading.

# Q17. Inheritance and Polymorphism.

# Q18. a. Raised when the specified key is not found in the dictionary. 
       b. Raised when an identifier is not found in the local or global namespace.
       c. Raised when trying to access a local variable in a function or method but 
          no value has been assigned to it.


# Q19. The program terminates abruptly and the code past the line that caused the exception 
        will not get executed.

# Q20. Use try, catch, except.

# Q21. Try – This method catches the exceptions raised by the program. 
       Raise – Triggers an exception manually using custom exceptions.

# Q22. Finally will be executed regardless of the exception block.

# Q23. The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors 
       while it is being executed.

# Q24. Try/Except. & Try/Except/Except

# Q25. The RAISE statement stops normal execution of a ubprogram and 
       transfers control to an exception handler.

# Q26. Assertions are simply boolean expressions that check if the conditions return true or not. 
       If it is true, the program does nothing and moves to the next line of code. 
       However, if it's false, the program stops and throws an error. It is also a debugging tool 
       as it halts the program as soon as an error occurs and displays it. 

# Q27. The with statement is a replacement for commonly used try/finally error-handling statements.

# Q28. *args specifies the number of non-keyworded arguments that can be passed and
       the operations that can be performed on the function in Python. 
       **kwargs is a variable number of keyworded arguments that can be passed to a function
        that can perform dictionary operations.

# Q29. There are two main ways to pass optional parameters in python 

            Without using keyword arguments.
            By using keyword arguments.

# Q30. A lambda function is an anonymous function (i.e., defined without a name) that can take
       any number of arguments but, unlike normal functions, evaluates and returns only one expression.

# Q31. Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other classes as derived, subclass, or sub-type classes. 
       Base class remains to be the source from which a subclass inherits. 
       For example, you have a Base class of “Animal,” and a “Lion” is a Derived class. 
       The inheritance will be Lion is an Animal.            

# Q33. The isinstance() method checks whether an object is an instance of a class whereas issubclass() method 
       asks whether one class is a subclass of another class (or other classes).           

# Q34. The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions, 
       where the variable should not belong to the inner function. Use the keyword nonlocal
       to declare that the variable is not local.          

# Q35. In Python, the global keyword allows us to modify the variable outside of the current scope. 
       It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.
